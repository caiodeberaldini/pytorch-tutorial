## About

This repository supplies code and tips for deep learning's researchers and/or pratictioners who crave to learn <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a>. It's based on <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html">Pytorch Deep Learning begginers' tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M">Python Engineer's Deep Learning with Pytorch free course</a>, and my own notes. I'll update it frequently, adding features not only restricted to the field of Deep Learning, but also from the more broad AI field. Hope you enjoy!
